# Project4_Search_Engine

Xitlali Lopez, CS5393-002_Project4, Collaborator: Naomi Murrieta 

Design Doc: Within this project, we were tasked with creating a search engine that would search through a huge data set of financial articles, allowing users to search based on keywords, organizations, and people. The search engine indexes articles by terms, organizations, and persons and ranks these results based on relevancy. The program processes the articles by removing stopwords and stemming. The index is stored in an AVL tree for querying and persistence. We will also implement a command line interface that allows the user to do various actions such as create persistence, run document parser, and more as a neat way to interact with the program.
